about:
  title: "About Me"
  subtitle: "My story"
  text: '<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, I am a 4th-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Davao Del Norte State College (DNSC). The COVID-19 pandemic presented a unique opportunity for students like me to enter the school without an entrance exam. This privilege, along with flexible classes, has allowed me to become the best version of myself, developing my skills while learning in the comfort of my home.</p><p>As a continuing student, I believe in the saying, "Malayo na pero malayo pa" (I have come so far, but still have far to go). I have reached this point, and I never thought I would achieve so much over the years.</p>'
